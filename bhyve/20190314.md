# Notes

**Michael Dexter** and **Rod Grimes** attended the last Project ACRN
call where they gave two WIP reports.

**Scott Philips:** Portland-based, works with Ben Widawsky.
Relatively new to FreeBSD Development.  Eight months or so.  Was a
Linux developer.  Looking to make the most impact for their resources.
Recently: Non-volatile/Persistent memory support.  Working on support
for namespaces/partitioning.  Following the ACPI spec.  His work on
Linux included: MESA 3D graphics driver, boot loaders, Android, and
protected media playback.

**Rebecca Cran:** Looked at get memory map.  Ten years with FreeBSD.
Worked on a UEFI-driver at work.  Also working on persistent memory.
NVDIMM-P.  Working on TianoCore UEFI.  Works for Western Digital (via
Fusion-io and SanDisk), based in Utah.  Working to include loader.efi
and include in installworld to facilitate scripting.  Will post a
review.  Looking into HTTP(S)-boot.

Patrick introduced himself to Scott and Rebecca. As did Michael.

Want list:

**Patrick Mooney:** A more capable UEFI-CSM that would be more aware
of network devices.  Looking at SeaBIOS in UEFI-CSM.  OVMF likely does
something similar.

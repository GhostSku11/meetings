- switch meeting one hour earlier (@bsdimp update calendar) for the meeting on the 28th march (17:00 UTC to handle DST stuff)
    - bsdimp will handle it

- FreeBSD 13.1-beta and drm should just work (after recompiling against the proper kernel sources).
    - manu will test during this week to make sure
    - binary compatibility should not be an issue [tm]

- x11-toolkits/Xaw3d can be updated freely

- xorg-server pr [260526](https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=260526) can go in
    - tcberner will do that some time soonish

- mesa 22 got released last week (hopefully all patches till apply, not yet looked at by manu)
    - probably wait for the first .1 release (no need to hurry)

- manu:
    - worked on syncing drm-kmod 
        - panfrost driver (for arm)
        - this should lessen pain for future imports
    - updating drm-kmod to 5.10 (eta end of this week)

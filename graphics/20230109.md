# 2023-01-09 Graphics Team Meeting

Attendees: Tobias Berner (tcberner@), Warner Losh (imp@), Adriaan de Groot (adridg@), (maybe others)

- tcberner:
    - will take over organizing the meeting for a while
- kde@/desktop@
    - still trying to figure out why plasma > 5.24 fails to start
    - did some printf debugging in startplasma but no progress so far
- kde@:
    - other updates all are going smoothly
    - wayland still broken likely, but cheriBSD got it working
        - [linkedin post](https://invent.kde.org/frameworks/prison/-/commit/14fb6f0a31373b242bdeb18cf9f3a36441bf86b5)
- gnome@
    - dead? fluffy and vishivin, but nc seems to be afk
    - maybe needs looking into in the future
- llvm default was bumped to 15
    - this makes ports by default in sync with graphics/mesa-libs so fewer different llvm installations on a desktop system are required
    - together with llvm.mk this should improve the situations some more
- desktop@
    - tiff security fix [267276](https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=267276) ready to land

- bsdimp will update the notes in the repo

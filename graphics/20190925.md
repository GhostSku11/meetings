*   12.1R driver compatibility
    *   Recent issue with 4.16-kmod built on 12.0 crash on 12.1 should now have been fixed in revision=352418.
    *   drm-fbsd12.1-kmod port? For v4.16 we can use same as 12.0. For v5.0 we have [https://github.com/FreeBSDDesktop/kms-drm/tree/drm-v5.0-fbsd12.1](https://github.com/FreeBSDDesktop/kms-drm/tree/drm-v5.0-fbsd12.1)
*   Jenkins
    *   Johannes L is now building all supported combinations of arch/drm-branch/fbsd-branch every 3 hours. Plan to move to proper build infra eventually. [https://people.freebsd.org/~johalun/drmlogs/](https://people.freebsd.org/~johalun/drmlogs/)
    *   Eventually we’ll integrate it with both FreeDesktop.org and FreeBSD.org’s CI efforts once this becomes mature.
*   Upgrade x11/libXvMC to 1.0.12
    *   [https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=240801](https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=240801)
*   Kernel source building
    *   Jhb and Warner talked about ways for making it better. John suggested tight integration with git to allow the best possible experience. John said he’d prototype something and we’ll talk in the next week or so. For the moment we’ll keep the defaults as they are on current.
    *   Some regressions are happening with 5.0 branch for different hardware. (drm-current-kmod).
        *   Broken updates of VT terminals (needs to be solved before we update the default) (try sysctl compat.linuxkpi.i915_enable_fbc=0, i915_enable_psr=X, )
        *   AMDGPU issues for some people, but not others (more prominent notice for loader.conf settings needed).
            *   Loader.conf var: `hw.syscons.disable=1`
        *   Still more testing needed to sort out the issues
*   Xorg update 1.20
    *   Have branch in github to do the update
    *   Working on updating the patches we have upstreamed
    *   Fell down a rabbit hole of continuing to support FreeBSD 2.2.8 (yes, 2.2.8).
    *   Some issues are known or suspected, so more testing and refinement is needed.
    *   Have our own devd backend and we may need to refine it to continue to work with 1.20.
    *   Considering using udev instead of devd backend.
*   Llvm90
    *   Not yet safe to upgrade.
    *   Lots of fallout that needs to be understood better.
    *   Binary packages may be broken.
    *   Unsure what to do about the sudden breakage situation.

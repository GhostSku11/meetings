### 2019-03-27: Agenda
*   DRM update
    *   Suggestions implemented and reuploaded to phabricator
    *   Drivers will define the linux KPI they want
    *   We will support at most 2 versions
    *   Warner to work with portmgr to see if there’s a faster pipeline for kmod package refresh to minimize time they are broken when we update linuxkpi...
*   Xserver 1.20.4
    *   Working through the issues. Progress is being made, but it’s slow
*   Mesa
    *   Niclas has a patch to do the update
    *   Niclas needs to do some basic testing, but will then send out a call for testing
*   New port for libxatracker (debian has this)? This is required by vmware drm driver and is a part of mesa  source code. It’s the only thing missing to have vmwgfx driver working.
    *   Port of the mesa source code
    *   Before Christmas there were issues, but perhaps they have been resolved
    *   Niclas to revisit to see what the current state is, what versions are supported, etc.
*   CI
    *   Li-Wen  hoping to setup the drm builds to help us keep from breaking things.
*   Q1 2019 report
    *   Please add items to current branch in github. Niclas or Pete will turn the vague things into beautiful prose.
*   Next meeting moves to UTC 1800 to cope with Daylight Savings Time in EU.

### 2019-07-17
*   armv7/arm64 status
    *   Working on getting linux red black tree code in for port
    *   Drm export module provides additional glue based on a fork of linux kpi
    *   Building BSDL versions of GPLd stuff in drm. Rewrote all the GPL code to have BSDL license.
    *   Manu to commit driver allwinner to support drm for on-chip video
    *   Michael to commit nvidia tegra updates for on-chip video
    *   Johannes and HPS to review this stuff
    *   Greg at unrelenting patches for PCI video to use device memory [https://reviews.freebsd.org/D20789](https://meet.google.com/linkredirect?authuser=1&dest=https%3A%2F%2Freviews.freebsd.org%2FD20789) and it’s ready to go
    *   Greg is working on PCIe video cards on arm apart from on-chip video
*   Freedesktop.org CI for FreeBSD
    *   This is our upstream for xorg and wayland stuff
    *   Use gitlab and other things for CI
    *   Talk about adding FreeBSD to their CI
    *   For Linux CI they use docker
    *   Support for running inside of a QEMU instance in gitlab
    *   No tooling to support flavoring our official qemu image (there’s no cloud-init). Sshd and serial console aren’t enabled by default, which causes logistical issues in integration.
    *   Tool needs to run on Linux to flavor the image or boot things.
    *   Freedesktop CI already does a lot of things for Linux, and they’d like to do similar for FreeBSD.
    *   Pointers from KDE upstream’s CI: The tooling used for the jenkins building: [https://invent.kde.org/sysadmin/ci-tooling](https://invent.kde.org/sysadmin/ci-tooling) / jenkins: https://build.kde.org / doc: [https://community.kde.org/Infrastructure/Continuous_Integration_System](https://community.kde.org/Infrastructure/Continuous_Integration_System)
    *   KDE CI uses custom FreeBSD installs that we manage ourselves (I think hosted on digital ocean, or Hetzner...). 
*   Wayland support
    *   POSIX posix_fallocate(2) doesn’t work on ZFS file system, so we have patches in a github branch to workaround the issue.

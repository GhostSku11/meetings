# 2022-05-09 Graphics Team Meeting  Notes

Attendees: Tobias Berner (tcberner@), Adriaan de Groot (adridg@), Warner Losh (imp@), Joseph Mingrone (jrm@)

- manu
    - changed how drm-ports work (previously `-${freebsd_version_name}-kmod`) -- now `drm-${linux_version}-kmod`
    - modern GPU require firmware: gpu-kmod-firmware port has been changed so that users don't have to install all the firmware, but can only install the one they need.
        - a metaport is still available so that users that are unsure can "have it all".
    - drm-kmod has been updated by wulf@ 
        - seems to work fine
    - currently working on making the module un-loadable
    
- adriaan
    - has been fixing buildfailures (random-thingies)
    - trying to get plasma-wayland to work again

- jrm
    - display port issues with sandy-bridge laptop -- external monitor suddenly turning off is probably specific to DP.
        - still not quite sure what the issue is

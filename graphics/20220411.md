# 2022-04-11 Graphics Team Meeting Notes

Attendees: Tobias Berner (tcberner@), Adriaan de Groot (adridg@), jrm,  Warner Losh (imp@)

- adridg@ vanquished a bunch of desktop@ bugs
    - cairo bug [257091](https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=257091) still needs some looking into
- glib related issues: 
    - glib-networking 
    - jbeich is also handling
    - would require some synchronization
- libxml2 
    - reverted to autoconf due to dependency loops with cmake
- kde@ not many new bugs

- is there something we don't do on FreeBSD that Linux does when unplugging HDMI displays (like automatically trigger xrandr) -> manu?

- ask more people

- warner: made sure that linux kpi is binary compatible for 13.1 to 13.0
    - plan is to have a windowed compatibility
    - limited abi stability within the window
    - 99% of binary incompatibility problem are solved by this
    - stuff had to be moved around a bit to made this work nicely
    - hopefully this approach makes it less painful than the 12.x release cycle
    - this will be properly resolved once manu moves the drivers back into the src
    - no guarantee: just a "best effort"

- CI: foundation is likely willing to support financially
    - hardware and people
    - what is mostly lacking is someone to spear-head it

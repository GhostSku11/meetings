### 2019-06-12
*   11.3 release
    *   Johannes are working on creating images for testing. Will create one for 11.3 for testing to make sure there’s no regressions.
*   Live USB images for testing
    *   Still work in progress
    *   The images needs 16GB USB memory sticks.
    *   [https://people.freebsd.org/~johalun/](https://people.freebsd.org/~johalun/)
    *   We’ll try to find a way to build the images in the FreeBSD cluster
*   Drm-kmod on 12.1
    *   Packages are built on the lowest common, meaning packages for 12.1 will be built on 12.0. This means that a 5.0 based drm kmod won’t build, and we have to make sure 4.16 keeps building on 12.1.
    *   Evaluate if we can create a drm-v5.0-fbsd12.1 branch with lindebugfs stuff reverted that will be available only from ports.
*   5.0 regressions
    *   Amdgpu: waiting for mmacy
    *   Drm: vt only redraws when switching vt.
*   Mesa llvm80
    *   Work in progress, to be published on github and tested.
*   Libxatracker
    *   [https://reviews.freebsd.org/D20153](https://reviews.freebsd.org/D20153)
*   Documentation
    *   Pete will ping Benedict regarding testing ASCIIDOC
    *   Will prep some minor updates if migration away from docbook is too long
*   Quarterly report

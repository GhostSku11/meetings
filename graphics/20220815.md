# 2022-08-15 Graphics Team Meeting
Attendees: Tobias Berner (tcberner@), Adriaan de Groot (adridg@), Warner Losh (imp@), Joseph Mingrone (jrm@)

- kde: Qt6 finally not segfaulting anymore (not due to us, but upstream did something, apparently)
    - exp-run pending (to ensure that Qt5 is not broken by the import)
- pam fix merged to 13-stable, should be in next release -> plasma 5.25 can be updated
    - 5.25 still has some issues (kactivitymanagerd not starting on its own, blocking startkde_x11)
- cmake 3.24 exp-run pending (lots of fun fallout)
    - has if_linux now... if_freebsd will be added for symmetry
    - will simplify patches, as you no longer need to compare operating system name to "FreeBSD"
- desktop:
    - cairo issues - pending update/plist fixes [263852](https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=263852)
- llvm-default/qdoc->LLVM_DEFAULT value
    - [263456](https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=263456)
    - [263302](https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=263302)
    - chasing the first would resolve the latter.
- se@ AMD issue probaby not in the "best-effort" range.
    - possibly add some documentation on the "best-effort" range and the expectiations users can have on the tree.
- foundation is interested in supporting FreeBSD/graphics

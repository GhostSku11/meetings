# 2021-10-18 Graphics Team Meeting Notes
Attendees: Tobias Berner (tcberner@), Warner Losh (bsdimp@), Niclas Zeising (zeising@), Emmanuel Vadot (manu@) 

- Update for X server update
    - Only portrevision nit.
- Mesa 21.3 is last of the 21 series
    - Manu waiting for it to become final
- drmkmod
    - thanks to Wulf we have 5.6 that's almost ready
    - 5.6.16 or 5.6.17 level
    - suspend / resume broken for amd laptop
    - amd is a mess, so bisection hard (problems fixes introduce regressions)
    - Kaby Lake suspend / resume broken traced to a single commit
    - Lots of cleanup on linux kpi directory
        - split include directory to have gpl and bsd licensed files separated
        - may do that c files too
    - Bump libclc level (llvm10->llvm11)
        - OpenCL may be broken with llvm11 patch
        - Updating to llvm12 in progress
        - Jan Beich created flavored version for SPIRV llvm11 needed for intel GPUs (spirv-llvm-translator)
    - Update graphics firmware to be flavorized so it's one per GPU type and generation [D32497](https://reviews.freebsd.org/D32497)
        - Default is that you'll get all the firmware, like before (though it's big 250MB due to AMD GPU firmware count)
        - But you can install just the thing you need, if you know what that is
        - drm port requires only a few things, so we'll keep it unified.
- Desktop and KDE Land
    - Things are generally good
    - Breakage on -current for a short time due to unconditional linux header (since fixed)
    - libinput updated (Adriaan did the update to 1.19)
    - Qt stopped supporting Qt5. KDE has a bunch of patches on top of our patches for KDE Qt patch collection.
    - Requests to make dbus optional, but there be dragons when enabled
        - Is quite complicated, and likely impossible
- Next meeting on Nov 8th rather than Nov 1st to avoid DST cutover differences between US and EU.

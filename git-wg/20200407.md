# Discussion
- gjb: needs a patch from bapt for a port to be used in the git jail
  (cgit perhaps?)
- uqs: have we contacted DragonFly BSD folks to ask about their experiences
  with vendor code, merges, etc.?
- emaste: have looked at DragonFly's git repo and believe that the approach
  they are using is subtree merges; `git subtree` is equivalent but syntactic
  sugar
- emaste will ask once we have some more specific/concrete questions
- FreeBSD 9.0 was released from CVS, FreeBSD 10.0 from Subversion

# Notes
- Discussion of vendor branches not being included in the default refspec
  - lwhsu was not aware and created cgit-dev copied from uqs' main git repo,
    so it has all branches
  - we should be able to rename them later (refs/vendor/... to
    refs/heads/vendor/...)
    - may have to provide some special instructions for users to update
  - Dist directory - vendor/foo vs vendor/foo/dist
    - uqs to check if we can do the rename (does vendor/foo preclude
      vendor/foo/dist?)
- lwhsu looking at commit hooks
- production date, would moving back one week help?
  - aim for Dec 5 for doc, 19th for src
- lwhsu acces file / [todos](https://hackmd.io/bK251VOfQAm6Gw1S5C5lRQ)

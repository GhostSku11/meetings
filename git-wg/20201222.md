# Git migration Working Group 2020-12-22

# Attendees
- emaste
- gjb
- imp
- lwhsu
- uqs
- glebius
- jhb
- bapt (part)

# Agenda
- [x] Doc repo punch list
  - lwhsu fixed PR commit updater
  - jhb has 2 reviews open for svn rev vs hash
      - https://reviews.freebsd.org/D27703
      - https://reviews.freebsd.org/D27704
- [x] Src - conversion bug
  - ipfilter (kernel) split in two refs (uqs), fix is easy but would respin
    everything from releng 10 and above
  - git replace --graft patches things up a little, but downstream need to
    explicitly fetch those
- [x] Src - vendor branch
  - where to stick them? DFly does refs/heads/vendor like any self-respecting
    git user would
  - it would look like this: https://cgit-dev.freebsd.org/src-test2/refs/
  - not too bad if we assume people pull from Github (and we don't push that
    stuff to GH anyway)
  - needs updates to all our vendor documentation
  - to avoid: having both refs/heads/vendors and refs/vendors, that would be
    the worst.
- [x] Src - MFC
  - Need to propose commit message format and discuss w/ community
  - Policy wrt squashing commits
- [x] Src - opening for commits
  - main branch only after call
  - postpone vendor and stable as commit hooks are finalized
  - expect 2 days for hooks and such, working in dev environment with delphij

# Discussion
- vendor branch ref location (refs/vendor vs refs/heads/vendor)
  - lwhsu prefers having refs/vendor/ hidden, points out we could push
    refs/vendor to GitHub
  - lwhsu's opinion is that we should push all *in use* branches to mirrors
    (e.g. refs/internal/*)
  - consensus: put in refs/heads/vendor in source of truth, do not push them
    to GitHub
    - send heads-up when it's going to move (folks will get some console spam
      when it happens)
  - we can propose a git patch to provide better control over listing branches
    if necessary
- admin branch under refs/heads?
  - does it need to be in the same repo?
  - we could bring over the three access files with history into a gitadmin repo
  - proposal: not into refs/heads, we will eventually move to a gitadmin repo
    later on
- ipfilter hiccough
  - consensus is to leave it
  - uqs is super sad :(
  - we can eventually produce an updated conversion (including sccs, cleaning
    up ipfilter) that can be git grafted
- GitHub path
  - rename freebsd to freebsd-src
  - create freebsd-legacy repo for old metadata
    - can't be a fork
    - `push --mirror`
  - push only major branches to GitHub
  - leave master in new one at first?
    - yes, that's ok
  - glebius can prepare the merge main->master commit for review
    - that commit can have a URL with instructions for migrating
  - set freebsd-legacy to archive mode once done
- MFC format
  - Send out messaging
  - caution should be exercised for now
  - the MFC commit message format might change because we want to support
    future tooling for identifying merge candidates
  - imp, jhb, emaste to hash out over IRC etc.
- gjb has a workflow question
  - git worktree is a suitable approach
  - does not have the convenient property of one 'svn up' to update everything
    though

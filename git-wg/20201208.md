# Discussion

- Commit mail format - per-commit vs per-push?
  - Prefer single mail per commit, in line with current SVN practice.
  - Can revisit later, after transition.
  - lwhsu will implement
- uqs found non-determinism issue in SVN commit notes
  - main and branch content is complete though, we can transition even
    if notes are not finished
- GitHub mirror
  - ready for pushing to main at any time
  - can delete stable/ branches manually and stand that up after
  - stalling for a day or two is fine
- Gitlab mirror
  - bapt reported earlier that it has pull-based support internally
- Commit mailing list names
  - Will switch to dev- prefixed ones, already created
- Branch and Tag policy
  - Precommit hook for new branch creation, commit to record "approved by"
    info etc.
  - Only annotated tag with "approved by" permitted
- Next steps to open push access
  - Commit simplified version of hooks
  - lwhsu to write simple doc on setting up environment
- src next steps
  - Need to write and publish schedule, including lessons learned from
    doc transition
  - git -> svn converter needs validation
  - uqs: commit notes are a mess, worst case we can hold off on SVN notes
    at first; content is fine
  - hold off on vendor imports for now, require individual requests
    (imp to mail developers/hackers)
  - New committers must have author map entries
  - Can simplify to "only plain HEAD commits and MFCs for now, by
    existing committers"
    - OpenSSL 1.1.1i pre-approved for jkim

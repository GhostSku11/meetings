# Discussion
- Need a jail to move bapt's prototype to
  - Prototype is OK but too slow for broader experimentation
  - Next step is to publish the repo to share it widely to provide an adequate
    experience for testers
- Need to sort out svn2git conversion issues
  - Vendor branches: existing conversion is OK
  - Tags: not sure what to do, uqs to open github issues to discuss
  - Need to get people to update their GECOS names for final conversion
  - uqs needs to push the conversion tool
- Meeting notes
  - Core suggests that we publish the meeting notes to the meetings repo more
    proactively.


- lwhsu reports that the repo host jail is set up by clusteradm
- bapt cannot join the meeting but will install / configure packages
- gjb: making progress on the release build code, hope to have something in
  svn user directory soon
- uqs: question about commit hooks, require that the committer = authenticated
  FreeBSD user
- broader discussion about commit names and author names; imp suggests that
  for the first iteration require committer = author = authenticated user
- uqs has been able to make mergeinfo (mostly) work in svn2git
- about 2000 of 3000 merge commits are handled successfully, about 1000
  have some strange mergeinfo that is not yet handled
- vendor branch has some diverse layouts
- discussion about branchs vs tags in git conversion; svn2git rules handle
  tags but make the rule set complicated
- uqs will create rules for initial set of tags, then the work can be done
  in parallel by others with guidance once the issues are sorted out
- emaste suggests using unique names while iterating on the conversion,
  e.g. name the branch master.20200421 or main.20200421 e.g.

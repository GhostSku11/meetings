# Discussion

- emaste tried Gleb's splitter (`git subtree split` alternative), found that it
  does not convert merges (e.g. vendor branch merges to contrib/).  Gleb will
  look at updating.
- gjb aksed about flag day conversion - will all three trees switch over at
  the same time?
  - not certain, could be doc first, then src then ports
- bapt working on mirroring of cgit-beta, there is now a mirror on gitlab
  - push --mirror was tricky / not working well
  - gitlab can pull by itself
  - will try same thing on GitHub
- bapt reports there is a svn server for git - will investigate, to continue
  providing svn view of the repos while releases originally produced from svn
  are supported
- default branch name: it appears Git / GitHub / GitLab will all be migrating
  to `main` as the default branch name over the next while
- discussed the svn2git merge conversions, uqs suggests we could perhaps drop
  all metadata from head -> projects branch (MFH / IFC)
  - believe this would be fine
- are any project branches in use today? at least one, rmacklem's NFS TLS work

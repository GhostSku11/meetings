  backend, now have expected output

  - limited by iwn
- cgi cwas the limitation, switched to 10 worker prefork, "good enough"
- uqs' collection was up to 20G, git prune is now 1.5G src, 1.8G ports,
  389MB docs
- clusteradm-provided machine is unreliable
  - build new packages, vuxml warnings but pkg update removed pkgs
  - switch to official repos maybe?

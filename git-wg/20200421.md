# Discussion
- lwhsu reports that the repo host jail is set up by clusteradm
- bapt cannot join the meeting but will install / configure packages
- gjb: making progress on the release build code, hope to have something in
  svn user directory soon
- uqs: question about commit hooks, require that the committer = authenticated
  FreeBSD user
- broader discussion about commit names and author names; imp suggests that
  for the first iteration require committer = author = authenticated user
- uqs has been able to make mergeinfo (mostly) work in svn2git
- about 2000 of 3000 merge commits are handled successfully, about 1000
  have some strange mergeinfo that is not yet handled
- vendor branch has some diverse layouts
- discussion about branchs vs tags in git conversion; svn2git rules handle
  tags but make the rule set complicated
- uqs will create rules for initial set of tags, then the work can be done
  in parallel by others with guidance once the issues are sorted out
- emaste suggests using unique names while iterating on the conversion,
  e.g. name the branch master.20200421 or main.20200421 e.g.

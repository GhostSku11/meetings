# Notes
- Mahya now parsing json file of service declaration, configuring casper
  service and executing unmodified binary program; most challenging part is
  now done, moving on to testing functionality
- Suggested this as a discussion topic for BSDCan, and/or the post-BSDCan
  Hackathon (Ed to forward details)
- Jon discusses the notion of commonality of a description about what a Casper
  service can provide (drawing on several examples now - e.g. Mahya's work,
  capsh, Super Capsicumizer 9000)
- There are multiple ways to choose between different implementations e.g.
  explicit runtime switch in libc, ifunc, compile-time options
- Mark expects to look at the rest of ELF Tool Chain now that strings is
  capsized
- Brian looking at areas where the research could go - e.g. compiler based
  instrumentation, it could be interesting to apply to those things Mahya is
  looking at
- Mark raises the question of statically linked binaries (as our oblivious
  sandboxing examples rely on `LD_PRELOAD`), and in particular with go this
  is a real issue
- Jon points out if one has bitcode an automatic transormation could work,
  but likely not applicable to go.  Presumably have to engage with whoever
  maintains go's "libc".

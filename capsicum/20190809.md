# Notes
Mark is working on capsicumizing toolchain.
He developed a mkostempsat function (https://reviews.freebsd.org/D21031).
This function was required by libarchive.
Mark during this work he also reported few fileargs issues:
* https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=239685
* https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=239700

We also briefly discussed the idea of saving configuration of the Casper in JSON file,
instead of modifying the code.
Maya pointed out that a similar approach is made in CapExec.

Durning capscumlization of the strip(1), Mark, changed that the program is creating a temporary file in the file directory instead of the /tmp/.
This approach is better, for example, because the move is an atomic operation.

Brain is working on SandCastles - a project which has a list of the application that is hard to sandbox.
It will also describe what the problem with the application is.
This may also be useful for other sandbox techniques in the feature.

He also describes how the capcheck works - https://github.com/bkidney/capcheck


Ali is working on a formally verified dot dot model as his final project.
The model is almost ready.

Maya and Marius were mostly working on the CapExec paper for the CNSM conference.

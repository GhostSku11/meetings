# Notes
## kernel permissions work (markj)
- done in local tree, patches going into review
  (probably by beginning of next week)
- kernel linker has two modes, compile-time `#ifdef SPARSE_MAPPING`
  in link_elf.c (implemented but not used)
- applies permissions specified in segments on dsos
- preloaded modules: add function to change permissions after the fact
  - by default start RW, kernel linker will change to RX (i.e., will change
    to specified permissions)
- add Makefile override for specific modules that need different settings
- vnet, pcpu don't work properly in PIC modules, existing hack used on other
  platforms works
- -f noplt compiler flag 
  - Added for PIC kernel modules modules
  - Investigating linker work

## syzkaller (markj)
- suggest we stop compiling sctp into the kernel
  - really need to be able to load transport modules as modules
- running on backtrace instance, most bugs found are in sctp
- also couple of vm bugs
- andrew added mount support and identified an issue, fix to be committed

## sanitizers (andrew)
- kasan - working on dmap issues
  - add compile or boot time option to disable use of dmap

## stack gap (kib)
- discussion about settings and defaults
  - provide improved way to control limits

## misc
- PIE load base when ASLR enabled
- kernel map reporting
  - want to add more details about submaps

## Structure of security teams
- Look to formalize PSIRT vs SecArch vs Crypto workstreams
- Think about generalizing the csprng group into crypto team

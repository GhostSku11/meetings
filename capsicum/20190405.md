# Agenda
- Capsicum test suite
- Bora's openrsync port (lstat and fts dependencies)

# Notes
- Capsicum test suite now integrated into the FreeBSD base system.
  - Status quo for upstream test suite location seems fine for now,
    reconsider if change velocity increases or David no longer has time
    to review and accept pull requests.
  - Is there a possibility of building the Linux port in some hosted CI
    system for testing the test suite on Linux?
  - Effort likely not worth it at this point, revisit if there is a renewed
    interest in the Linux port.

- openrsync
  - Bora's WIP patch depends on lstat support in cap_fileargs and on changes
    to fts to allow use in a sandbox
  - One fts issue is that it changes the working directory
  - Mariusz shared a refreshed fts patch implementing no-chdir
  - fts also used open(), patch changes to openat
  - Mariusz will separate out whitespace changes and commit those
  - Ed / Bora will review and test the functional changes (FreeBSD test suite,
    other ad-hoc testing).
  - lstat changes nearly ready for commit, some minor comments outstanding in
    the review

- Capsicumized strings now committed
  - bootstrapping issue had to be fixed as well
  - Ed will prod upstreaming effort along

- tcpdump fails to open IPSEC key file in capability mode
  - [PR 236819](https://bugs.freebsd.org/236819)
  - Expedient fix is to add to cansandbox check, avoid sandbox if
    `-E file foo` specified
  - Most likley the file should just be opened prior to entering the sandbox
  - Would be interesting to see if static analysis or other approaches would
    identify this issue

- Brian's notes
  - LOOM LLVM instrumentation now working and integrated with the FreeBSD
    build framework
  - Research questions - can move beyond static analysis to using dynamic
    analysis based on instrumentation

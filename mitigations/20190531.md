# Agenda

# Notes
- Access to a machine within Intel for CET work is in progress
- `MAX_PROT`
  - allow it to be set and honour it if userland wants to
  - commit with a implied sysctl for testing
  - mprotect - needs VM API changes?
  - John points out that we'd like mprotect to work from the beginning so that
    `#ifdef` can be used e.g. in ports
  - mprotect should be pretty straightforward; brooks has no time in the near
    future but will review
- Syzkaller
  - Andy, Mark have been looking at syzkaller things
  - i386 now running at Google (from Waterloo hackathon)
  - error where client dies - possibly writing bad data into the kcov buffer
    (currently investigating)
  - appears sysbot found one i386-specific issue so far (sendmsg/uipc_send),
    trivial reproducer
  - Kostik suggests testing on i386 kernel will find other classes of issues
    (i.e. because of 4/4G split)
  - how difficult would it be to run i386 kernel within GCE? we can run it in
    bhyve
  - Syzkaller deployment questions (if GCE i386 is tricky) - investigate cloud
    providers, Sentex machines when they're otherwise unused, FF-purchased
    hardware?
  - Syzkaller report triage - lots of issues with SCTP, mostly falling to
    tuexen@
  - jhb: should we make SCTP optional (as a module as default); markj will
    begin investigating
  - Listening socket locking bug, discussed with glebius@, proposal to rework
    locking
  - Syzkaller finds many different forms of this issue
  - Sometimes difficult to reproduce; C reproducers tend to be reliable but
    still need to run in a loop etc.
  - markj stuck on presumed buffer corruption issue, follow up with Dmitry on
    how Linux protects it
- ptrace changes for pointer authentication
  - need to update man page, compat32 before commit
- Merging SCP wildcard changes back to 11.x?
  - Decide not to do it, suggest 11.x people install port/pkg
- Question about rolling out mitigations in separate kernels
  - Kostik points out observed incompatibilities with ifunc
  - pkg base is our desired path forward to solve this issue
  - need to figure out what we will do in the short term in the freebsd-update
    world
  - idea: use beta pkg base as the way to do this
- jhb: we should focus effort to determine which things belong in GENERIC

# Agenda
- static PIE
- [ELF tagging tool](https://reviews.freebsd.org/D19290)
- Mitigation defaults

# Notes
## Discussion of moving architectural type issues within Secteam into this venue.
- Look to see if delphij is able to join this call.

## Static PIE
- Identify relocations - one of
  - build binaries as static PIE
  - discuss with lld authors
  - investigate lld source for relocations generated

## ELF tagging
- Ed needs to finally review
- kib will take another look

## ASLR defaults, documentation
- Need holistic documentation about security knobs
- We do have a security.7 page already, how current is it?
- What are the defaults?
- kib will brain dump mitigations available. gordon will run with it to get it
  into some documentation.

## Stack randomization
- What requires fixed stack locations?
- variable stack gap rather than moving the whole stack map
- needs only 16 byte alignment, not page alignment
- `ps_strings` location
- default stack size is 0.5GB
- need to refactor fixup code, would be useful for CHERI
- concerns over 32-bit address space fragmentation
  - do we care about 32-bit in this context?
- kib will look at it as time permits

## fhold overflow check / refcount KPI changes
- kib fixed after reading a
  [security analysis blog posting](https://secfault-security.com/blog/FreeBSD-SA-1902.fd.html)
  prompted by kib's [SA-19:02.fd change](https://reviews.freebsd.org/rS350199)
- mark investigating other users / possible issues
- returning error may not be possible, possible approaches:
  - widen refcount to 64 bits (on `LP64` at least)
  - implement saturating counter, trade use after free with memory leak
- expecting update for next call

## Clang stack protector CVE
- Commits have gone into llvm
- We need to bring in the changes, talk to dim@
- Andrew will forward details
- https://kb.cert.org/vuls/id/129209/
- https://reviews.llvm.org/rL366371
- https://reviews.llvm.org/rL367068

## max_prot / W^X
- Brooks will write a journal article on `max_prot` and it will touch on `W^X`
- Straightforward to bring in CHERIBSD `W^X` implementation (currently logs and
  accepts)

# Agenda
- `MAX_PROT`
  - committed as [r349240](https://reviews.freebsd.org/rS349240)
- ELF tagging
- Syzkaller

# Notes
- `MAX_PROT` and discussion of test integration
  - Have test be tagged as modifying global state and have it change the sysctl
  - For testing `MAX_PROT` itself use procctl when hooked up
  - We would like to test the global control as well
  - Brooks has little time available, someone else can add procctl and ELF tags
  - kib will add opt-out ELF flag, and procctl enable/disable
  - brooks comments that we should enable/disable based on ABI level
  - Ed will get back to reviewing Bora's tool
  - Investigate interaction with image checksum - probably just a note in the man page
  - Discussions around defaults and the stance we want to take
- Syzkaller
  - Mark set up netdump in his instance
  - Making SCTP loadable as a module is fairly difficult
  - Going through outstanding issues this week and next
  - netdump in public Syzkaller feasible but a logistical difficulty
- Mark expects to wrap up kernel W^X work soon
- Andy continuing to work on ptrace changes
- Looking into fuzzing at Cambridge w/ CheriBSD
  - NetBSD GSoC fuzzing project of interest?
- Mariusz mostly focused on Capsicum things
- CET blocked on machine access
- LL/SC change
  - markj identified one bug in rview
  - pho discovered i386 broken
  - expect to commit once pho's next round of testing + markj review is complete
  - brooks will give it a try in his tree on MIPS

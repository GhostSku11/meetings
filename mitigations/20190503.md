# Agenda
- Intel indirect branch CET
- Desire for a wiki page on mitigations we have / do not have / want
- `MAX_PROT`

# Notes
Ed will review Bora's ELF modification tool.
Kostik asks whether the tool rewrites the ELF or just overwrites byte(s).
Looking at [the review](https://reviews.freebsd.org/D19290) it's the latter.

`MAX_PROT` should be ready to commit with a global enable/disable; we can
add the per-process/binary control afterwards.

Kernel W^X and pmap code to audit kernel page tables - some code, but not
much work here of late.

Mark has been working on syzkaller. It is finding many bugs that can be
triggered by an unprivileged user; they're being fixed when found.

Also submitted a [pull request for the syzkaller bhyve backend](https://github.com/google/syzkaller/pull/1150).

syzkaller is getting stuck on some common bugs/issues (e.g. unix epoch
timestamp panic, ufs sparse file seek, etc.) and then doesn't make progress

Andrew submitted ptrace patch but has not yet been able to look at feedback
after holidays.

BSDCan discussion.

Discussion of some in-progress security issues.

# Notes

## CPUs and Interrupts

Discussion of skipping hyperthreaded logical cores.  It is doing that
based on mask returned from `bus_get_cpus()`.

## LRO on VLANs

**Drew** came up with a patch, gave it to **Marius**.

**Marius** found a few bugs, and found that things still don't work.
Back to Drew.

## Non-abdicate Transmit Performance

non-abdicate transmit perfomance (gallatin, pkelsey)

**Drew:** Cache misses on mp ring consumer update after r->drain()
returns.  Thinking about hacking the drain to bail out at various
points, seeing where the cache misses start to show up.

**Patrick:** Are any drivers using tx interrupts?  Does iflib really
support that?

We suspect everything is using on-demand cleanup.  Patrick will do an
inventory to see if he can find any driver that is using tx interrupts
directly for tx cleanup.

## MFCs

**Marius:** looking at merging fixes back to 12 in a KABI compliant
fashion.  Has a patch the removes assumptions that everything is an EM
mac & remove unneeded workarounds from other drivers paths.

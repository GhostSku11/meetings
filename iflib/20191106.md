# Notes

## Removing `mp_ring`

**Stephen**: Still working on this.  Performance is much better.
Still have a shared lock between rx and tx.  Resolving that might let
us get a skootch more performance and be better than it ever was
rather than just back to the level of pre-iflib.

Netmap is also way less-broken with this change since it is now
working the way netmap(4) expects.

## netmap(4)

**Olivier**: Are you aware of any users who are using netmap(4)?

**John**: I know Krion is using it with bhyve.

**Stephen**: The issue with netmap is you have to provide your own
protocol stack.

**John**: I think layer 2 and IP and even UDP aren't that hard to
implement, it's TCP that's a pain.

**Ollivier**: Nothing really to talk about from my side.

**John**: Me neither, I'm just here to take notes.

**Stephen**: I'm mostly just here to show that I can still show up to
meetings.

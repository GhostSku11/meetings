# Notes

**Drew** updated an older machine he has (dual-core Xeon from 2009)
updated to do some benchmarking on lower-end hardware.  He found that
tx_abdicate actually made performance worse, perhaps due to overhead
of context switches on the older CPUs.

**Drew** looked a little at the LRO / VLAN issue Marius reported
earlier but hasn't setup the VMs to debug that yet.

**Drew** is also still wanting to work on redoing LRO, but wants to
ensure it doesn't impact performance on lower-end machines.

**Marius** has also been busy with other things the last two weeks.

**Drew** and **Marius** are both trolling ebay for test hardware

Some discussion on [PR 236734](https://bugs.freebsd.org/236734) where
igb(4) is not reporting link state correctly (it claims link is always
up which breaks things like carp(4)).

## Hyperthreading CPUs

There is an e-mail thread where Patrick Kelsey asked to have a knob to
control if RX and TX worker threads are tied to separate threads
within the core associated with a queue set vs having RX and TX worker
threads bound to the same thread within the core.  The current default
is to use separate threads, but Patrick is asking for coalescing the
threads.  Some discussion about workloads that might benefit from one
layout vs the other.  **Stephen** will follow up on the thread to get
more details on Patrick's workload and how it is impacted.
